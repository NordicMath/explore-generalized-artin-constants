Topics to explore:

- Statistics for decimal expansion of 1/p for primes p.
- Statistics for the sequence 10^k mod p for primes p.
- Also 2^k mod p and other geometric series (relate this to Artin's constant)
- Fibonacci period lengths mod p and other similar sequences
- Later: Plot p vs pi(p) for various sequences
